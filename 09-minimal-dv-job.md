With some stripped data located, it's useful to store the information on the 
selected particles inside an ntuple.
This allows for quick, local analysis with [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/), 
rather than always searching through a DST that contains lots of things we're 
not interested in.

As well as being the application that runs the stripping, 
[DaVinci](http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/davinci) 
allows you to access events stored in DSTs and copy the information to ROOT 
ntuples.
You tell DaVinci what you want it to do through _options files_, written in 
Python.
There are lots of things you can do with DaVinci options files, as there's lots 
of information available on the DST, but for now we'll just work on getting the 
bare essentials up and running.

Our main tool will be the `DecayTreeTuple` object, which we'll create inside a 
file we will call `ntuple_options.py`:

```python
from Configurables import DecayTreeTuple
from DecayTreeTuple.Configuration import *

# Stream and stripping line we want to use
stream = 'AllStreams'
line = 'D2hhCompleteEventPromptDst2D2RSLine'

# Create an ntuple to capture D*+ decays from the StrippingLine line
dtt = DecayTreeTuple('TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi')
dtt.Inputs = ['/Event/{0}/Phys/{1}/Particles'.format(stream, line)]
dtt.Decay = '[D*(2010)+ -> (D0 -> K- pi+) pi+]CC'
```

This imports the `DecayTreeTuple` class, and then creates an object called 
`dtt` representing our ntuple.
Once DaVinci has run, the resulting ntuple will be saved in a folder within the 
output ROOT file called `TupleDstToD0pi_D0ToKpi`.

The `Inputs` attribute specifies where `DecayTreeTuple` should look for 
particles, and here we want it to look at the output of the stripping line 
we're interested in.

As stripping lines can save many decays to a DST, the `Decay` attribute 
specifies what decay we would like to have in our ntuple.
If there are no particles at the `Input` location, or the `Decay` string 
doesn't match any particles at that location, the ntuple will not be filled.

Now we need to tell DaVinci how to behave.
The `DaVinci` class allows you to tell DaVinci how many events to run over, 
what type of data is being used, what algorithms to run over the events, and so 
on.

There are [many configuration 
attributes](http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/davinci/releases/v36r6/doxygen/py/dc/d2f/class_da_vinci_1_1_configuration_1_1_da_vinci.html#ac788f6a80f5f61d47056debe7b86ca71) 
defined on the `DaVinci` object, but we will only set the ones that are 
necessary for us.

```python
from Configurables import DaVinci

# Configure DaVinci
DaVinci().UserAlgorithms += [dtt]
DaVinci().InputType = 'DST'
DaVinci().TupleFile = 'DVntuple.root'
DaVinci().PrintFreq = 1000
DaVinci().DataType = '2012'
DaVinci().Simulation = True
# Only ask for luminosity information when not using simulated data
DaVinci().Lumi = not DaVinci().Simulation
DaVinci().EvtMax = -1
DaVinci().CondDBtag = 'sim-20130522-1-vc-md100'
DaVinci().DDDBtag = 'dddb-20130929-1'
```

Nicely, a lot of the attributes of the `DaVinci` object are self-explanatory: 
`InputType` should be `'DST'` when giving DaVinci DST files; `PrintFreq` 
defines how often DaVinci should print its status; `DataType` is the year of 
data-taking the data corresponds to, which we get from looking at the 
bookkeeping path used to get the input DST; `Simulation` should be `True` when 
using Monte Carlo data, `Lumi` defines whether to store information on the 
integrated luminosity the input data corresponds to; and `EvtMax` defines how 
many events to run over, where a value of `-1` means "all events".

The `CondDBtag` and `DDDBtag` attributes specify the exact detector conditions 
that the Monte Carlo was generated with.
Specifying these tags is important, as without them you can end up with the 
wrong magnet polarity value in your ntuple, amongst other Bad Things.
You can find the values for these tags in the [bookkeeping 
file](data/MC_2012_27163003_Beam4000GeV2012MagDownNu2.5Pythia8_Sim08e_Digi13_Trig0x409f0045_Reco14a_Stripping20NoPrescalingFlagged_ALLSTREAMS.DST.py) 
we downloaded earlier.

In order to run an algorithm that we have previously created, we need to add it 
to the `UserAlgorithms` list.
The `TupleFile` attribute defines the name of the ROOT output file that DaVinci 
will store any algorithm output in, which should be our ntuple.

All that's left to do is to say what data we would like to run over.
As we already have a data file [downloaded locally](05-files-from-grid.html), we 
define that as our input data.

```python
from GaudiConf import IOHelper

# Use the local input data
IOHelper().inputFiles([
    './00035742_00000002_1.allstreams.dst'
], clear=True)
```

This says to use the `.dst` file that is in the same directory as the options 
file, and to clear any previous input files that might have been defined.

That's it! We're ready to run DaVinci.

In the same folder as your options file `ntuple_options.py` and your DST file 
ending in `.dst`, there's just a single command you need run on `lxplus`.

```shell
$ lb-run DaVinci v36r6 gaudirun.py ntuple_options.py
```

The full options file we've created, `ntuple_options.py`, is [available 
here](./code/09-minimal-dv/ntuple_options.py).
