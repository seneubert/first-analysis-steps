To try and figure out why your decay descriptor does not work,
type the following into the python terminal

>>> advance()
>>> stream = '$MYSTREAM'
>>> line = '$MYLINE'
>>> candidates = evt['/Event/{0}/Phys/{1}/Particles'.format(stream, line)]
>>> head = candidates[0]
>>> print_decay.printTree(head)

Can we find match the candidate with the decay descriptor?

>>> decay_finder.hasDecay(candidates)

Beware, you can not repeatedly call this. It somehow keeps track
of how often it has been called/recursion stuff :-s
