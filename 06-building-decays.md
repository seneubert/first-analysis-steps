> * Build a decay chain 

In order to perform most physics analyses we need to build a *decay chain* with reconstructed (or MC) particles that represents the physics process we want to study.
In LHCb, this decay chain can be built through `LHCb::Particle` (`LHCb::MCParticle`) objects that represent individual particles and contain links to their children, also represented by the same type of object.

We'll learn all the concepts involved by running through a full example:
using the DST file we downloaded in the [Downloading a file from the Grid](05-files-from-grid.html) lesson, we will build our own $D^*\rightarrow D^0(\rightarrow K \pi) \pi$ decay chain from scratch.
Get your [LoKi skills](https://lhcb.github.io/first-analysis-steps/06-loki-functors.html) ready and let's start.

The typical approach is to build the decay from the bottom up. Therefore, we need to

  1. Get input pions and kaons and filter them according to our physics needs.
  2. Combine a pion and a kaon to build a D0, and apply selection cuts to it.
  3. Combine this D0 with a pion to build the D*, again filtering when necessary.

To do that, we need to know a little bit more about how the LHCb analysis framework works.
As discussed in the [Gaudi introduction](01-davinci.html), `Gaudi` is based on the event-by-event sequential (chained) execution of algorithms wrapped in a `GaudiSequencer`, which takes care of handling the execution order such that processing stops when an algorithm is *not passed*.
However, it does not handle the data dependencies between these algorithms nor does it give easy access to them.
To solve this problem, the [Selection Framework](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/ParticleSelection) was created, and it is based on two types of objects: `Selection` and `SelectionSequence`.

> ## Selections {.callout}
> The `Selection` is the basic unit of the framework. It uses other `Selections` to process `LHCb::Particles` and writes them to a TES location easily findable through its `outputLocation` method. Additionally, it knows about other `Selections` that it requires to pass in order to obtain input particles through its `RequiredSelections` argument.
> A `Selection` requires *all* of its `RequiredSelections` to pass.
>
> There are several types of selections, for example
>
> - `Selection`, the most basic class.
> - `MergedSelection`, which is used to join the output of several `Selection` objects into a single TES location.
> - `DataOnDemand` (also known as `AutomaticData`), which builds objects from their TES location using a preconfigured map of (location, algorithm) pairs.

> ## Selection sequences {.callout}
> The `SelectionSequence` takes a `Selection` object, resolves its `Selection` requirements, and builds a flat, chained and ordered list of `Selections`. It then exports (via the `selection` method) a self-contained `GaudiSequencer` with all the algorithm configurables necessary to run the selection.
> It also makes the output locations of the data written by the selection chain available via the `outputLocations` method.

To get our input particles we use the `DataOnDemand` service:

```python
from PhysSelPython.Wrappers import DataOnDemand
Pions = DataOnDemand('Phys/StdAllNoPIDsPions/Particles')
Kaons = DataOnDemand('Phys/StdAllLooseKaons/Particles')
```

> ## Finding the correct inputs for `CombineParticles` algorithms {.callout}
> As discussed previously, the `DataOnDemand` or `AutomaticData` selection builds objects from their TES location.
> In Gaudi, the TES location of the output of an algorithm is generally determined as `Phys/ALGO_NAME/OBJECT_TYPE`, where `OBJECT_TYPE` refers to `Particles`, `Vertices`, etc.
>
> The `CommonParticles` package, which you can find [here](https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/lhcb/browser/Stripping/trunk/Phys/CommonParticles/python/CommonParticles), allows to access premade particles with reasonable selections for us to use with `DataOnDemand`.
> For example, in our specific case, we use the `DataOnDemand` class with the `Phys/StdAllNoPIDsPions/Particles` and `Phys/StdAllLooseKaons/Particles` locations to access the output of the `StdAllNoPIDsPions` and `StdAllLooseKaons` algorithms, respectively:
> 

Once we have the input pions and kaons, we can combine them to build a D0 by means of the `CombineParticles` algorithm.
This algorithm performs the combinatorics for us according to a given decay descriptor and puts the resulting particle in the TES, allowing also to apply some cuts on them:

 - `DaughtersCuts` is a dictionary that maps each child particle type to a LoKi particle functor that determines if that particular particle satisfies our selection criteria. Optionally, one can specify also a `Preambulo` property that allows us to make imports, preprocess functors, etc (more on this in the [LoKi functors](https://lhcb.github.io/first-analysis-steps/06-loki-functors.html) lesson). For example:

    ```python
    d0_daughters = {
      'pi-': '(PT > 750*MeV) & (P > 4000*MeV) & (MIPCHI2DV(PRIMARY) > 4)',
      'K+': '(PT > 750*MeV) & (P > 4000*MeV) & (MIPCHI2DV(PRIMARY) > 4)'
    }
    ```

 - `CombinationCut` is a particle array LoKi functor (note the `A` prefix, see more [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/LoKiHybridFilters#Particle_Array_Functors)) that is given the array of particles in a single combination (the *children*) as input (in our case a kaon and a pion). This cut is applied before the vertex fit so it is typically used to save CPU time by performing some sanity cuts such as `AMAXDOCA` or `ADAMASS` before the CPU-consuming fit:
 
    ```python
    d0_comb = "(AMAXDOCA('') < 0.2*mm) & (ADAMASS('D0') < 100*MeV)"
    ```
 
 - `MotherCut` is a selection LoKi particle functor that acts on the particle produced by the vertex fit (the *parent*) from the input particles, which allows to apply cuts on those variables that require a vertex, for example:

    ```python
    # We can split long selections across multiple lines
    d0_mother = (
      '(VFASPF(VCHI2/VDOF)< 9)'
      '& (BPVDIRA > 0.9997)'
      "& (ADMASS('D0') < 70*MeV)"
    )
    ```

Then, we can build a combiner as

```python
from Configurables import CombineParticles
d0 = CombineParticles(
    'Combine_D0',
    DecayDescriptor='([D0 -> pi- K+]CC)',
    DaughtersCuts=d0_daughters,
    CombinationCut=d0_comb,
    MotherCut=d0_mother
)
```

Now we have to build a `Selection` out of it so we can later on put all pieces together:

```python
from PhysSelPython.Wrappers import Selection
d0_sel = Selection(
    'Sel_D0',
    Algorithm=d0,
    RequiredSelections=[Pions, Kaons]
)
```

This two-step process for building the `Selection` (creating an algorithm and building a selection with it) can be simplified by using a helper function in the `PhysSelPython.Wrappers` module, called `SimpleSelection`.
It gets a selection name, the algorithm type we want to run, the inputs and any other parameters that need to be passed to the algorithm (as keyword arguments), and returns a `Selection` object build in the same two-step way.
With that in mind, we can rewrite the previous two pieces of code as

```python
import GaudiConfUtils.ConfigurableGenerators as ConfigurableGenerators
from PhysSelPython.Wrappers import SimpleSelection
d0_sel = SimpleSelection(
    'Sel_D0',
    ConfigurableGenerators.CombineParticles,
    [Pions, Kaons],
    DecayDescriptor='([D0 -> pi- K+]CC)',
    DaughtersCuts=d0_daughters,
    CombinationCut=d0_comb,
    MotherCut=d0_mother
)
```

Note how we needed to use the `CombineParticles` from `GaudiConfUtils.ConfigurableGenerators` instead of the `PhysSelPython.Wrappers` one to make this work.
This is because the LHCb algorithms are configured as singletons and it is mandatory to give them a name, which we don't want to in `SimpleSelection` (we want to skip steps!).

> ## The LHCb singletons {.callout}
> If we had tried to simply use `CombineParticles` inside our `SimpleSelection`, we would have seen it fail with the following error
> 
> ```output
> NameError: Could not instantiate Selection because input Configurable CombineParticles has default name. This is too unsafe to be allowed.
> ```
>
> The reason for this is that all LHCb algorithms need an explicit and unique name because they are *singletons*, and therefore an exception is thrown if we don't do that.
> A [singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. In our case, only one algorithm with a given name can be instantiated.
> This allows to reuse and reload algorithms that have already been created in the configuration sequence, eg, we could have reloaded the `"Combine_D0"` `CombineParticles` by name and modified it (even in another file loaded in the same `gaudirun.py` call!):
>
> ```python
> d0_copy = CombineParticles('Combine_D0')
> print d0_copy.DecayDescriptor
>```
>
> This is very useful to build complicated configuration chains.
>
> The solution for the `SimpleSelection` problem, in which we actually don't care about the `CombineParticles` name, is the `GaudiConfUtils.ConfigurableGenerators` package: it contains wrappers around algorithms such as `CombineParticles` or `FilterDesktop` allowing them to be instantiated without an explicit name argument.

Now we can use another `CombineParticles` to build the D* with pions and the D0's as inputs, and applying a filtering only on the soft pion:

```python
dstar_daughters = {
  'pi+': '(TRCHI2DOF < 3) & (PT > 100*MeV)'
}
dstar_comb = "(ADAMASS('D*(2010)+') < 400*MeV)"
dstar_mother = (
    "(abs(M-MAXTREE('D0'==ABSID,M)-145.42) < 10*MeV)"
    '& (VFASPF(VCHI2/VDOF)< 9)'
)
dstar_sel = SimpleSelection(
    'Sel_Dstar',
    ConfigurableGenerators.CombineParticles,
    [d0_sel, Pions],
    DecayDescriptor='[D*(2010)+ -> D0 pi+]cc',
    DaughtersCuts=dstar_daughters,
    CombinationCut=dstar_comb,
    MotherCut=dstar_mother
)
```

> ## Building shared selections {.callout}
> In some cases we may want to build several decays in the same script with some common particles/selection;
> for example, in our case we could have been building D0->KK in the same script, and then we would have wanted to select the soft pion in the same way when building the D*.
> In this situation, we can make use of the `FilterDesktop` algorithm, which takes a TES location and filters the particles inside according to a given LoKi functor in the `Code` property, which then can be given as input to a `Selection`:
> 
> ```python
> from Configurables import FilterDesktop
> soft_pion = FilterDesktop('Filter_SoftPi',
>                           Code='(TRCHI2DOF < 3) & (PT > 100*MeV)')
> soft_pion_sel = Selection('Sel_SoftPi',
>                           Algorithm=soft_pion,
>                           RequiredSelections=[Pions])
> dstar = CombineParticles(
>     'CombineDstar',
>     DecayDescriptor='[D*(2010)+ -> D0 pi+]cc',
>     CombinationCut="(ADAMASS('D*(2010)+') < 400*MeV)",
>     MotherCut=(
>         "(abs(M-MAXTREE('D0'==ABSID,M)-145.42) < 10*MeV)"
>         '& (VFASPF(VCHI2/VDOF)< 9)'
>     )
> )
> dstar_sel = Selection(
>     'Sel_Dstar',
>     Algorithm=dstar,
>     RequiredSelections=[d0_sel, soft_pion_sel]
> )
> ```
>
> This allows us to save time by performing the filtering of the soft pions only once, and to keep all the common cuts in a single place, avoiding duplication of code.


We can now build build a `SelectionSequence` to add to the `DaVinci` execution sequence

```python
from PhysSelPython.Wrappers import SelectionSequence
dstar_seq = SelectionSequence('Dstar_Seq', TopSelection=dstar_sel)
from Configurables import DaVinci
DaVinci().UserAlgorithms += [dstar_seq.sequence()]
```


> ## Debugging your selection chain {.callout}
> The `PhysSelPython.Wrappers` offers a very useful utility for debugging your selection chains, called `PrintSelection`.
> It gets a `Selection` as input and it can be used the same way, except it will print the decay tree everytime making use of the `PrintDecayTree` algorithm which was discussed in the [Exploring a DST](05-interactive-dst.html) lesson.
>
> For more complex debugging, one can setup `DaVinci` with `graphviz` (see more details [here](http://www.graphviz.org))
> ```shell
> SetupDaVinci --use "graphviz v* LCG_Interfaces"
> ```
> and create a graph representation of the sequence of algorithms and their dependencies:
> ```python
>from SelPy.graph import graph
>graph(dstar_sel, format='png')
>```
><img src="./img/Sel_Dstar.png" alt="Dstar selection graph" style="width: 500px;"/>
>
> Note that currently it is not possible to load `graphviz` with `lb-run`, but it is expected it will be possible in the near future.


> ## Work to do {.challenge}
>  - Finish the script (the base of which can be found [here](code/06-building-decays/build_decays.py)) by adapting the basic `DaVinci` configuration from its corresponding [lesson](09-minimal-dv-job.html) and check the output ntuple.
>  - Replace the `"Combine_D0"` and `"Sel_D0"` objects by a single `SimpleSelection`.
>  - Do you know what the used LoKi functors (`AMAXDOCA`, `ADAMASS`, `MIPCHI2DV`, etc) do? 
>  - Add a `PrintSelection` in your selections and run again.
>  - Create a `graph` of the selection.
